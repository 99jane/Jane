# Hi there, I'm Jiayin Chen
I'm a Biostatistics graduate student at University of Toronto starting from 2021.

Currently, I'm working on a few interesting projects at the following places:

- **School of Life Science at Sun yat-sen University**
- **[Shen-Group](http://www.shen.se/) at Sun yat-sen University**

- **Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at University of Hong Kong**
- **[SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH](https://sph.hku.hk/)**

Also, I worked as an Product Manager intern at PingAn Insurance Company.

## What I'm working on

- **Partition Genetic Correlation**

Currently I improve LDSC precision in genetic correlation estimation by adding LD score subdiagonal weights with Prof. Xia Shen at  Sun yat-sen University. We want to enhance the efficiency on Partition Genetic Correlation. This project is still active as we work to bring it more general.

- **Early vs delayed metformin for newly diagnosed diabetes**

We are looking at early vs delayed metformin for newly diagnosed diabetes. After looking at health outcomes (mortality and complications), we did not find much difference in outcomes except time to treatment intensification (defined as time to insulin). We decide to look at changes in intermediate measures/surrogate biomarkers, i.e. HbA1c similar to the DRCP paper attached.
