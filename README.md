# Hi there, I'm Jiayin Chen
I'm a Biostatistics graduate student at University of Toronto starting from 2021.

Currently, I'm working on a few interesting projects at the following places:

- **School of Life Science at Sun yat-sen University**

- **Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at University of Hong Kong**

Also, I worked as an Product Manager intern at PingAn Insurance Company.

## What I'm working on

- **Partition Genetic Correlation**

Currently I improve LDSC precision in genetic correlation estimation by adding LD score subdiagonal weights with Prof. Xia Shen at  Sun yat-sen University. We want to enhance the efficiency on Partition Genetic Correlation. This project is still active as we work to bring it more general.

- **Speed up the individual survival model**
